MD-Tracks is a trajectory analysis toolkit for molecular dynamics and Monte
Carlo simulations. It is designed to interact with several simulation codes that
generate trajectory data: CP2K, CPMD, DLPOLY, GROMACS, LAMMPS. The trajectory
output files are first converted into a in a uniform binary format, which can
then be processed with a bundle of analysis scripts, e.g. for the analysis of
vibrational spectra, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and so
on.
